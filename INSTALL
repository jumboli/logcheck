Logcheck Installation 
=====================

Extract the file logcheck-x.x.x.tar.gz by using command

	tar -xvzf logcheck-x.x.x.tar.gz

Change to the created directory
	
	cd logcheck-x.x.x/

and edit files logcheck.whitelist and logcheck.logfiles.


logcheck.conf
-------------

Please change parameters in logcheck.conf. 
Check twice for correct mail settings!


logcheck.whitelist
------------------

Contains a list of phrases to ignore as "ok". Each single 
line you place here will be ignored when parsing the 
logfiles.
A line can also be a regular expression, please look into 
the logfiles.whitelist for more information.


logcheck.logfiles
-----------------

Contains the path to the logfiles which should be
parsed by logcheck.pl. Each line represents one
logfile with full path. When running as cron don't 
use relative paths!


checking installation
---------------------

Run the command
	
	/path/to/logcheck.pl debug

to check your installation. Emails will not become sent 
in debug mode.


installing a cronjob
--------------------

Use command
	
	crontab -e

and put a line similar to the follwing into it:

	*/10 * * * * /path/to/logcheck.pl

Thats it...
