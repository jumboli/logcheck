# ignore entries that match, match is when part of whitelisted string is in actual parsed line of logfile
#
# examples:
# "this entry" 
# would match to lines containing "this entry", but not to lines containing "this is an entry"
# to match this you will need regular expressions like
# "this(.)*entry"
# this matches to both examples...
# BE CAREFIL WHEN USING REGEX, OFTEN YOU MAY COVER MORE THAN EXPECTED!!
# in normal textlines without regex you will need to mask characters like \ or .
